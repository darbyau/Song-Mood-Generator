# 🎵🎧 Song Mood Generator

The **Song Mood Generator** is a fun, randomized message generator that suggests the perfect song vibe for your day. It combines **Genres**, **Moods**, and **Settings** to give you a unique music recommendation every time you run the program.

<!-- ## ⚙️ How It Works (for me)
When you run the generator, it randomly selects:
- A **Music Genre** (e.g., Lo-fi, Jazz, Trap)
- A **Mood** (e.g., Chill, Hype, Dreamy)
- A **Setting/Situation** (e.g., Rainy night drive, Beach sunset)

These elements are combined to generate a message. -->
